# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
Android Developer Nanodegree Program, Project N1

In this project, i complete the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

Our task and starter code are there:
[Sandwich Club app starter code.](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code)

My implementation features:

1)ConstraintLayout and layout editor usage
2)If some json objects are absent the app will not crush but show log messages about it.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:
- Learn how to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

## How Do I Complete this Project?
Download the [Sandwich Club app starter code.](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code)

Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
